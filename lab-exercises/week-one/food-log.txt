Update food log: 1/7/20 @ 3:18 AM; I'm writing this because I couldn't sleep, it's been more than 6 hours since my last commit, and I have noting better to do. I ended up having fish (I believe it was trout.) with fajita vegetables and broccolini. I also had another diet coke, a packet of m&m's, and a bowl of apples and blueberries. I will update this again tomorrow evening with a full list of what I end up eating today.

Update food log: 1/7/20 @ 1:48 PM; change of plans; I'm just going to finish today's log right now. I still haven't eaten anything yet, but I'm thinking about getting another poke bowl right now.

Update food log: 1/8/20 @ 12:35 AM; got a poke bowl with soda for lunch (I believe the soda  was a cherry Pib Zero), then I snacked on some milano cookies and gummy bears, then for dinner I had ground turkey with fajita vegetables with a side of carrots and celery, for dessert I had watermelon with Tajin and a bowl of apples

Update food log: 1/8/20 @ 7:21 PM; had a mocha frappucino bottle in the morning as well as acai primo bowl from Jamba Juice. I will now venture to ralphs and purchase some broccoli, trout, and fajita veggies for some pan fried fish and vegetable stiry fry. Might have some fruit for dessert.

Update food log: 1/9/20 @ 5:28 PM; Ended up having the trout with veggies last night along with a bowl of sticky rice. Instead of fruit, however, I had two packs of Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey bars (for a total of four bars) and a pack of m&m's, a decision about which I am extremely ashamed. I also had an Arizona iced tea last night. My first meal for today was a dragon roll from Kika Sushi in Ackerman. Later, I had a Red Bull so that I could stay awake in my animal behavior class. In about two hours, I will be heading off to a birthday party, where I will likely be eating lots of junk food.

Update foog log: 1/9/20 @ 11:31 PM; Got back from the birthday party not long ago. Ate pizza and salad with a diet Pepsi. Might have some fruit tonight. Might not.

Update food log: 1/10/20 @ 11:15 AM; Ended up making myself a bowl of blueberries and apple slices last night. I also had some water last night. THis morning I had a large cup of coffee.
