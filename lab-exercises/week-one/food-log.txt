Update food log: 1/7/20 @ 3:18 AM; I'm writing this because I couldn't sleep, it's been more than 6 hours since my last commit, and I have noting better to do. I ended up having fish (I believe it was trout.) with fajita vegetables and broccolini. I also had another diet coke, a packet of m&m's, and a bowl of apples and blueberries. I will update this again tomorrow evening with a full list of what I end up eating today.
